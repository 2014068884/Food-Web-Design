<p>Chowking  is a Philippine-based chain. The concept combines a Western fast food service style with Chinese
food. Chowking predominantly sells noodle soups, dim sum, and rice toppings. The company was founded in 1985,
at a time when Western-style burger joints were dominating the Philippine fast food scene.

History
In 1989, Chowking started expanding its market share amid the volatility of the domestic market. It opened its
franchising operations  and made its entry into the provincial markets the same year. On January 1, 2000, Chowking
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Jollibee Foods Corporation. The new owner commenced store renovations to create
a new corporate look for Chowking that would result in a comprehensive change for each store..</p>
