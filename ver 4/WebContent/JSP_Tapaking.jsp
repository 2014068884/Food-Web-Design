<p> In 1987, the first.apa King was born along Gallardo Street in Makati i. The idea was to give customers a rice meal alternative to hamburgers,
 hotdogs and pizza he real Pinoy  comfort food that is filling and reminds you of your favorite home-cooked meals.
 <br><br>
 From a humble aim of providing a homestyle food option in the clutter of fast food restaurants, Tapa King is now one of the top Pinoy favorites. With quality products and appealing service, the brand expands its reach as it continues to open branches not just in local destinations, but all over the world.
Now with a new business model known as the Budget Tapa King, affordable but good food is now within the reach of every Filipino.</p>
