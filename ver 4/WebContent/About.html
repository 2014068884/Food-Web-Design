<h1  class = "title">ABOUT US</h1>
<p class = "ex2">Students always ask themselves: Where are we going to eat? With the help of this website,
students can now easily browse their choice of restaurants around the carpark. They don't need to walk their
way to the venue itself while still uncertain of where to eat. They could just look it up on one website.

This website showcases the UST Carpark itself and its popular restaurants. It gives an information about the restaurant
to give the students an overview of what kind of restaurant would they want and from that information, they will have an
idea of what do they want to eat. There are different varieties to choose from but a student could only pick one and the
more likely an affordable restaurant to maintain their budget. This also promotes the UST Carpark itself since it is safe
and within the school grounds. Visitors can also comment and/or mention a review of their experience eating at UST Carpark.
In that way, future students and current UST students could learn and relate with one another in terms of food inside the school.
