<p>A pancake house, pancake and waffle house or waffle house is a restaurant that specializes in breakfast
items such as pancakes, waffles, and omelettes, among other items. Many small, independent pancake houses,
as well as large corporations and franchises, use the terminology in their establishment names, most notably
the International House of Pancakes (IHOP), Waffle House and The Original Pancake House. Most pancake houses
are dine-in, although most will offer carry-out as well. Many are open until around 3 p.m. Exceptions to this
are large chains such as IHOP and Denny's, which are usually open 24 hours. Some independent pancake houses are
found in strip malls, or exist as stand-alone structures that have been re-fitted, such as a closed-down diner
or retail store.
