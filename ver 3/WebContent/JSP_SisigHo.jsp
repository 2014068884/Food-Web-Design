Sisig Horray is the most sought pulutan. Sisig was believed to have originated from Pampanga. It was made
from a pig's head and liver, mixed with chopped onions, chicharon and kalamansi. The pig parts were the items
that were frequently thrown away or fed to the animals, so the Kapampangans found a way to save the meats.

Sisig Horray started out in 2005, Sisig Horray started giving the masses the best tasting sisig the public
ever tasted. It was founded by Immanuel D. Balce of Chop Chop Yum Yum, who wanted to make the most beloved pulutan
very popular by serving it with hot, steaming rice. the first food cart opened at Ever Gotesco Ortigas, where it
became a really popular hit and extraordinary long lines have been produced every day. The crew would chop the pig's
heads and livers right in front of the customer's amused eyes, entertaining them and ensuring that their sisig will
be very fresh!</p>
