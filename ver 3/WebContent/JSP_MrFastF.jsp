<h1 class = "title">MR. FAST FOO</h1>
<p class = "ex2">Located at the Ground Floor of the UST Carpark.

Mr. Fast Foo is the latest Chinese fast food dining experience that promises "fantastic feasts served fast."
And what I mean by fast, it's amazingly "3 minutes fast". The fastest by restaurant industry standards.

The price is a bang for the buck. For Chinese food served fast, this is quite affordable. Probably because they
intended this for students. Their two branches are located within the vicinity of the universities. The students
can actually afford their meals. No debates about this. They deserve a good score here.</p>
