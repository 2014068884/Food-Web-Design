Chansel Pizza House serves different kinds of pizza flavors like all meat, pepperoni, hawaiian, seafoods,
chicken barbeque. They also serve rice value meals.

This pizza was typically available in two variants only. First is the Special, made with sweet tomato sauce,
ham, onions, bell pepper, and cheddar cheese that stick to your teeth. And second is the Hawaiian, made with
all the above-mentioned ingredients plus pineapple chunks.

Of course Pinoy pizza is far from the real deal that we now take for granted because of the countless international
pizzerias and Italian restaurants that have set up shop in the Metro. But there are days when I truly long to taste
that sweet-style neighborhood pizza of my youth again. Greenwich Pizza used to taste like Pinoy pizza, but not anymore.
