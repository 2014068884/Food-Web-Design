Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. is an American global doughnut company, and coffeehouse chain based in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Krispy Kreme founder Vernon Rudolph bought a yeast-raised recipe from a
New Orleans chef, and in 1937 rented a building in what is now historic Old Salem in Winston-Salem, and
began selling to local grocery stores.

In the United States, Krispy Kreme's products are sold via their own outlets as well as through grocery
and convenience stores and supermarkets. They are also available in other countries through various channels.

The company's growth was steady prior to its initial public offering but profits have decreased in recent quarters.

On February 24, 2015, Krispy Kreme opened its 1,000th shop in Kansas City, Kansas.
