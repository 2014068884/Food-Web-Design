Quickly is one of the largest tapioca milk tea franchises in the world,
with over 2000 locations in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. Quickly is the brand name of Kuai Ke Li
Enterprise Co. Ltd., which was founded by Nancy Yang in Taiwan and started franchising.

Quickly Corporation was founded in California and started its trademark licensing program at the same time.
Quickly began marketing themselves as a New Generation Asian Fusion-style cafe in the USA, as opposed to just
a tapioca drink shop. Most locations offer free Wi-Fi internet access.

On May 17, 2008, Quickly officially launched their new age non-fat tart frozen yogurt at the SingTao Asian Expo.
The frozen yogurt became available at their key locations the following week. In March 2010, Quickly officially
launched their Hong Kong style egg puff which became available at all their
locations in Northern California.

Quickly stores in San Francisco became the center of former Supervisor Ed Jew's extortion controversy, where he
solicited bribes estimated at $84,000.
