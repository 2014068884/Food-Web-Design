Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) is a fast food restaurant chain that specializes in fried chicken and is
headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the world's second largest restaurant chain
(as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 18,875 outlets in 118 countries and territories as of December 2013.
The company is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains.

KFC's original product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' recipe of 11 herbs and spices. The
constituents of the recipe represent a notable trade secret. Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard
"bucket", which has become a well known feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in
1957. Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet burgers and
wraps, as well as salads and side dishes, such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts, and soft drinks, the latter often
supplied by PepsiCo. KFC is known for its former and current slogan "Finger Lickin' Good", which was replaced by "Nobody
does chicken like KFC" and "So good" in the interim.
